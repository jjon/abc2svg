This is a BBEdit text filter for transforming `abc` music notation into a block of `SVG` that renders standard music engraving so that BBEdit may display a preview. To use it you have to have `nodejs` present on your system, and you have to install Daniel Narey's `scoped` ES module [abc-render-svg](https://github.com/folkdb/abc-render-svg) like this: `npm install @folkdb/abc-render-svg`. That module, in turn relies on Paul Rosen's [abcjs](https://github.com/paulrosen/abcjs) module, and the [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) module. Everything you need is in `@folkdb/abc-render-svg`.

This ES module will not support `require()` so the node script needs the file extension `.mjs` in order to import the module. That `.mjs` file needs to live at `~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Text Filters/abcjs_preview.mjs`. Use it by selecting some ABC text, and invoking the `abcjs_preview` Text Filter. The selected text will be replaced by an SVG element which BBEdit can preview.
